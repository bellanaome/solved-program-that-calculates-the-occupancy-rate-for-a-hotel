Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for a hotel (Using basic C++ like forloops,ifelse,while, etc. NO functions/arrays)



The program should meet the following requirements:

Displays a title, and welcome message to the user.Ask the user how many floors the hotel has (do not accept an answer less than 1).For each floor, ask the user to enter the total number of rooms.

For each floor, ask the user if any rooms are currently occupied (the amount occupied should never surpass the total number of rooms on that floor). Allow the user to respond with only ‘Y’ or ’N’ (If the users anything other than these responses, display an error message and ask the user to respond accordingly. If the answer is ‘Y’, ask the user to enter the number of rooms that are currently occupied.

The program’s final output should contain:

1) The total number of rooms on each floor.

2) The number of rooms currently occupied on each floor.

3) The number of rooms currently unoccupied on each floor.

4) The floor’s occupancy rate (Number of rooms currently occupied divided by the total number of rooms)

A summary of the entire hotel that includes

1) The number of floors

2) The number of rooms occupied

3) The number of rooms unoccupied

4) The hotel’s occupancy rate (Number of rooms currently occupied divided by the total number of rooms in the hotel)

The output should resemble the following:
